# CSIS110, HW5B, Python portion (Animation), Fall 2023. Julien Niles, 12/10/23 

#This program takes an image of a boxing ring with a referee and two shapes (one oval and a rectangle) as the boxers. Once they collide, the ref runs towards them to breakup the fight and red text shows up saying red was knocked out.
