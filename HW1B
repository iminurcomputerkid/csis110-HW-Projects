#9/26/23, Homework 1b Image Sequence 
#This program will take an image of a beach and run it through a function that will decrease the blue value by half, decrease red and increase green. After it will take all the images and display them in a slideshow with 3 seconds in between each image. 

#Page 88 in Python variation
#This function decreases blue pixels by half
def decreaseBlue (myPic):
  for p in getPixels(myPic):
   value=getBlue(p)
   setBlue(p, value*.5)
#Lab 2 ClearRed Function Variation 
#This function sets the red pixels to 50
def decRed (myPic):
  for px in getPixels(myPic):
    setRed(px, 50)

#This function increases the green in the picture
def increaseGreen (myPic):
  for pix in getPixels(myPic):
    setGreen(pix, 160)
#This function creates a slideshow of the picture of the beach manipulated through the functions above.

 myPic = makePicture( "beach.jpg" )
